Who is Walid: Hello, my name is Walid, I am 33-years old and work as an information technologist in a city centre bank. It's a full time job but I have been there for the last year or so.

I moved to the UK from the Middle East with my wife and young family 3 years ago. I undertook a year of postgraduate IT study at a local university before getting this job. It is well-paid, but stressful job.

Increasingly, I have been struggling with stress and some anxiety. My physical health is a constant worry to me and I am sure it’s affecting my mental health. A few months ago I started to feel some aching in my lower back. I thought it would go away but it didn’t, so a few weeks later I went to see my GP. He said to have some time off work and rest and he also said it was OK to take some pain killers. 

I am really worried because this pain is stopping me from being as active as I would like to be, and I have two young children. My main worry is that the pain will not go away, and possibly even get worse. My wife is looking for a part-time work but I am the main source of income for our family. 

I know that back pain is caused by things like slipped discs and I have an uncle who can barely walk now because of his bad back. I’d like to do things, but just can’t live like this.  



Hi Walid, Thanks for coming in. Your

GP's referred you all

I have is a small note that
you've got low back pain.

So what we want to do
today is have a good talk.

And I can do some tests and

checks and see what's going on and

try and get to the
cause of everything,

and see what we can do to help.

Thank you.

Before I start, can I just
check a couple of details?

Yeah, sure. Your name.

I've got Walid Mohammed.

Great. And your date of birth?

29th of October, 1990.

Yes. Excellent.

Thanks for that. So that
makes you 33? Yes, yes.

Lovely. Okay, so I just want
to have a chat with you.

First of all, to establish
your side of the story and

get a real insight into what
you've been experiencing.

So to start off with,

can you just tell me
everything from around

the onset of the back pain and
what's been happening since?

Yes. Okay. Yeah. So
we moved to the UK.

Me and my young family,

my wife and two children,
three years ago.

So I started a new job as
information technologist.

And it was stressful for me because

I needed to prove
myself to the company.

And the other thing, it's

a different culture and not much
social life back in my country.

At that time. I remember being so

stressful and anxious
about everything,

and things got worse
when this back pain started,

like eight months ago.

Eight months ago, I tried
to do some football some gym to ease it up.

I thought it could help me
with that, but it didn't help.

Five months ago, I
went to see my GP,

he said rest when it gets worse.

And he said, I can take painkillers.

But none of that helped me.

And I think it's getting
worse and stopping

me from doing things
as I would like to.

Okay, thanks for that insight.

I'm just making some notes as we talk.

Sure, that's fine.

Again, just to check that
around eight months ago,

it started eight months ago.

A lot of stress and
anxiety around that time.

Yes. Yeah. Because of
the new job band.

Yeah. Yeah. Lots of
things going on there.

And you tried some sport?

And I tried football for a
few weeks and I went to gym,

but none of that
has helped with it.

So overall, would you say

it's about the same or it's
steadily getting worse?

I think it's getting worse.

Okay.

It's getting worse by time.

Okay. Okay. Really, I just want to

find out a bit about where
you're feeling the pain.

Your GP says you've
got low back pain,

but that could mean
a lot of things.

Can you just sort of tell
me in your own words

where you feel pain or
any other sensations?

So the pain started at my
lower back, at the right side,

and recently I realised that it's

pulling down my buttocks and my thighs.

So it's going down now.

Okay. So, the right side

of your back and how
would you describe that?

the sort of feeling of it

it's dull being it's not it's not,

like, very severe or something.

It's like I feel it's a
stiff and dull pain.

Okay. And then you've got

this sensation down
your thigh as well?

Yeah. I think I feel it's

going down to my buttocks
and thighs as well.

Right. Okay. So can I just check

one or two things about the
thigh pain that you've got?

Yes, sure. How far down the back

of your leg would it would
you say it goes Well?

I think it's halfway
down my my thighs. Okay.

Yes. Do you get any pain at

all below your knee
or in your lower leg?

No.

Do you get any pain in your foot?

No.

No? No. And any other
sensations like

a tingling sensation or

a numbness of around
your leg or your foot?

I don't recall having any of those, no.

Okay. So just just pulling
down halfway down my thighs,

yes. Okay. Thank you.

Okay. So the next thing Walid,

I want to try and
establish how sort of

bothersome this is to you and

what impact it's
having on your life.

And in terms of something
we call severity,

which is a sort of
measure of, you know,

how you think, how severe you
think this painful episode is.

I know that you're
taking medication and

you don't respond to that much.

Does this keep you
awake at night at all?

Yes, sometimes it does keep
me awake when it is very bad.

It does do that. Yes.

Okay. And if we sort of established
that sort of very bad thing,

so if I gave you a scale
from nought to ten,

nought is no pain at all,

and ten is the worst
pain you could imagine.

Okay? So with regards to
both sites of those pains,

because we talked about your
back pain and the leg pain,

what would you say the
back pain is at its worst?

Think it seven out of ten.

Okay. Okay. And then the leg pain,

is that any difference
or is about No, no.

I think they are the same.

The same I think as seven
out of ten as well.

Okay. Yeah. Great. And what sort
of things aggravate the pain?

When I'm sitting down for
long times and probably

when I'm bending down to pick

up one of the children or
pick up something Right,

it aggravates it. Yeah.

Okay. And can that come on quite
quickly when you bend down to

pick something up or do
you have to be doing

it all day? No.

Come kind of quickly?

Yeah. So when I bend down and
try to pick up one of the kids,

I can feel it the way Yeah.

If that happens.

So it's sort okay.

You bend down to pick one of
the kids up or something,

then you feel the pain?

Yes. How long does it
then take to settle?

Does it stay like that? Does it go

immediately when you stand up
or does it linger on all day?

I would say it can last for a
couple of hours or so. Okay.

Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's
great. Thank you.

Okay Walid, just with your health

generally because it's nice
to get a feel if anything

else is going on or if there's

any other sort of stressful events

or but if I can

get a bit of information about

your general health, that
would be great as well.

So do you drink or smoke?

No, not at all.

Okay. Okay. Would you

say there's anything else
that we need to sort

of understand about your,
your general health?

No. Generally, I think
I'm healthy. I'm fit.

It's just this pain
that makes me anxious

and worried and I think it's
making me short tempered as well.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And you think it's the pain
that sort of driving that?

Yes, I think so. Yeah. Yeah. And I

think I've lost some
weight as well.

Right, The last few weeks.

Yeah. I think I lost about
5 - 6 kilogrammes.

Right. Okay. Is there

any reason for that particular
or I can't think of any now.

Okay. But yeah, I generally am
fit and well unless this pain.

Okay. Yeah, that's great.

Okay. I just want to try
and get an understanding of

your physical activity
and how much you do.

It's great that you tried to go
to the gym and play football,

but obviously that didn't do

anything to help the
back pain. Yeah.

And I can't do that any,

so I think I do less than an hour
a week of physical activity.

Okay.

And I think recently I started
to get fatigue very quickly.

And I think physical activities

disturb my sleeping at
night and pain as well.

So I, I stopped
going to the gym and

playing football
and Okay. Yes. Yeah.

Sounds like the
interesting thing is we

know that exercise is generally

a good thing for people
with low back pain.

But in your case, it seems like
you've tried certain types

of exercise and they're
just certainly not helping.

But maybe stirring things up a bit.

Yes, yeah.

Okay. Okay. Just to check
with your work again,

you work in IT, Computers.

And I do that full time.

Full time.

It's hard to keep
physical activities

and going to the
gym with the stress

of the work and the pain
and everything that is going on.

Okay. And just with regards
to your family history,

so the health of your mother and father

essentially, is there anything?

So my mother has got hypertension.

Right. Okay. And my father has
got high cholesterol levels.

Okay. Other from that,

I can't recall anything else.

No. Okay. Yeah.

Medication wise, you
mentioned earlier

that the GP suggested you try
some paracetamol for the pain.

Do you still use that at all?

I still use it sometimes
when it gets worse.

But it doesn't help? No.

Okay. Okay. We've got some
great information from you Walid.

So thanks for going through that, it really helps me

understand your insight into
your painful experience.

So in a moment, we're going to
look at some of your movements

and do a couple of tests
that need to do it again,

just to continue creating

an understanding of what's

going on here and more importantly,

what we're going to do about it.

Okay, But before we do that,

I just want you to
fill in a short form.

It's only got a few
questions or so

I'll leave
you to fill that in

and I'll go and get ready
for our examination.

Okay? Yeah.

Explain

Okay. Walid.

As explained. What we're going
to do now is just look

a little bit at the way you
stand, the way you move.

I'll need to put my hands
on a little bit and

we agreed that that would
be the case earlier.

And it's all again,
just to try and really

establish what's happening and

what's the cause of your pain
and what we can do about it.

So first of all, I just want

you to forget I'm here
and just stand there.

And I'm going to sort of
observe the way you stand,

the way you shift your
balance and things.

And that's absolutely fine

if I just go around the
back and say, okay,

if you just roll your
T shirt up a little bit,

you just get a sense of
whether your muscles are being

really overactive or that.

That's great. Fine. Yeah,
that's absolutely fine.

Yeah, I'll just look
from this side. Okay.

Now, if you could,

you can put your T shirt back
down again if you want to.

Can you just take a few steps and

walk towards the wall and
then walk back to me?

Yeah. Again, I'm just observing
the way you move and Okay.

Okay. Okay.

And if anything we do
causes your pain or

you start to think the pain is

going to come on, just let me know.

Don't do anything, just say,

I think this is going to be too

painful and that's absolutely fine.

Yeah. Okay. But what we can do now,

if it's all right, if you can
just roll your T shirt up again.

Yeah. And I'm going to ask you to
do some very simple movements.

Just normal movements of the
that you would be doing.

Now, you told me earlier

that the worst movement
was moving forward.

So we'll leave that one to last.

But just a look at your
other movements first.

So again, you're in
control. You're in charge.

If you're worried about anything,

just don't do it.

We'll have a chat about
it. Ye but can you just

sort of lean back as far as
you're comfortable with?

Okay. Yeah, that's
great. Thank you.

And can you lean to

your left side and you

put your arms down by
your side? That's okay.

Thank you. Yeah. Is that okay?

Yes. Yes, to the other side.

Just as far as you're
comfortable with.

K. Okay. That's fine.

And now, the one that

you don't enjoy the most,
they're picking up things.

Can you just lean forward as
much as you're happy with?

I think. Okay, I can't go anymore.

Your movement, you got
movement there which is great.

You know, your backs working.

It's limited because
you're worried about

about the pain, especially
coming forward.

Yeah. But you do go around

picking things up and picking
the kids up and everything,

so I just want to see
how you would do that.

I gave you a small
little weight which is

less weight than one
of your children.

But again, any sign

that the pain is coming on either
in the back or in the leg,

just let me know, okay?

Yeah. But if I was to ask you
how you would pick that up,

just show me what you
would do, Okay? Okay.

So and then if you're happy to
put it back down again. Yeah.

Is it okay? That's great.

So I'll just move that away.

So again, you can see you're very

sort of guarded of your back there.

It's all coming from you get

strong legs anyway.
Do you doing that?

But what we'd want to work
towards is for you to let

that go a little bit
in a comfortable way.

So that's a really good test we

could keep having a look at doing.

Yeah, but if I asked
you now just to unstiffen

your back and sort of just

roll your back out so
this became curved,

so going forwards
again with it. Okay.

Just show me what ah,

you really don't like that, do you?

No. No. Okay. That's fine.

Is the pain okay though?

We haven't we haven't caused
the pain to come on too much.

No. Yeah. Yes, it is a bit. No.

Okay. That's great. One more thing.

Yeah. Can you just
stand on your left leg?

Yeah. So that's fine.

You okay now, can you do the same
on your right leg? I try to.

Just a couple of seconds.
Okay, that's fine.

Again, it gives us some clues
about what muscles are working,

what joints are involved in
it. So that's absolutely fine.

So what we're going to do now,

I'm going to get you
on the bench and

we're just going to
do a little bit of

movement analysis and see

where the main stiffness
is coming from, okay?

Yeah. Okay.

So we've had a look at you
moving and walking and standing,

and we're starting to get a feel

of how things are looking there.

In a moment I'm going to do some
movement on the bench with you,

as we discussed. Okay

But before we do that,
I just want to do what

we call a neurological test now.

That's nothing serious. It doesn't

sound it's not as bad as it sounds.

Because you've got
some of this pain that

comes down the back
of your leg here.

It's good for us just to check

whether or not the nervous
system is involved in it.

So there's a couple of things
I'm going to do just to see

if your muscles are working,
your sensations, okay?

And you got good reflexes, okay?

All you have to do is
follow my instructions

and sit there and do things, okay?

So I'm going to start
down at your foot.

What I want you to do is push

your big toe up against my
thumb as hard as you can.

Yes, lovely.

And then push down
as hard as you can.

Then bring your foot up against
my hand as much as you can,

and push down as hard as you can.

Lovely. Can you
straighten that leg out?

Yes, sure. Don't let
me move it. Okay.

And bend it a bit. And
don't let me pull it up.

Okay. Now I'm going to
do the same on that leg,

You might feel it's going to be
a little bit more provocative.

So you just say if you don't
want to do anything, but again,

it push down with the big toe.

Push up with your foot. Push
down with your foot. Excellent.

Now, can you straighten
this as much as

you're comfortable with?

And don't let me push it.

Okay. And don't let me
pull it any straighter.

Okay, great.

So the good news is
all your powers there,

it's equal in both legs.

Oh, so that's absolutely fine.

Yeah. I'm just going to put

this soft tissue down the
side of your leg there,

and I want you to tell me,
first of all, do you feel that?

Yes. And does that
feel the same there?

Yes. Okay. Now, I want
you to close your eyes.

Okay? And I'm going to do it
on one leg and then the other.

And all I want you to do is
tell me if it feels the same.

Okay? On your right leg.

So, yes,

yes, yes, the same.

Yes, yes, same feeling.

Great. Okay. You can
open your eyes again.

Last thing, just want to

check how quickly these
muscles are working, okay?

Okay. Yeah. So all
I'm going to do is tap

that hammer just against just
below your kneecap here.

Okay? Okay. It won't hurt.

In fact, I'm going to bash it

on my finger rather than your knee.

Okay. Don't think about it.

I'll just watch what's going on.

Okay, lovely. Thank
you on this side.

Lovely. Great. Just
check the pieces out.

Same at your ankle. Lovely. Okay.

Everything's fine. So
we can have a look

at your movement now on
the bench, if that's okay.

Okay. Yeah.

Okay. So as explained,

what we're going to do
now is I'm going to get

you on the bench in a couple
of different positions,

and I'm going to use
my hands to try and

just assess what's
happening in your back.

This isn't really about, you know,

we can't find if there's

a particular joint at
fault or anything.

Back pain doesn't
really work like that,

but it gives me a good sense, okay,

of your willingness to move
what your muscles are doing,

and see if we can find

a way to facilitate some
better movement as well.

It won't be too long ago, but
the first thing I want to

do is just for you to lie
face down on your front.

And I'm just going to
rub my fingers up and

down your back to get a sense of
your joints and your muscles.

If you're happy the brakes
are on here, this is fine.

You get in and out of bed all day,

every day anyway, at night time.

So it should be okay.
But if you can find

a comfortable way of you
lying down, face down.

That would be brilliant.

Can you take these off me. Yes you want me to
hold those for you.

That's lovely. There's
a breathing hole

there if you need
it or you can have

your head to one side,
whatever's most comfortable.

Yeah. And if you just roll this
up a little bit, that's lovely.

Again, anything causes either
your back pain or your butt pain,

or both, or you just
don't like the sensation,

then just say you're in charge.

Okay? I can't actually see
your eyes at the moment.

Okay? So I'm relying on you
telling me things, okay? Okay.

I'm just going to draw
these down a touch, okay?

And if there's any particular part
of your back that I press on,

this feels quite sensitive here and

your muscles are really
reacting to my pressure there.

Yeah. Okay. That's fine.

Okay. Now, what I'm going
to ask you to do, Walid,

if you're happy to do it,

is actually turn on your side
to face me, if that's okay.

And then I'm just
going to put a pillow.

And again, I'm just
going to try some of

those movements myself so you don't

have to use your muscles
this time, okay?

Yeah. I'll try and
produce the movements.

And again, just to see your
willingness to move and see if

there's any way we can turn this

into something therapeutic
for you as well.

Okay. So you're happy like that?

Yes. Yeah.

Okay. I'm going to take the weight
of your legs as I bring them.

Feel you really resisting
that movement there?

Yeah. Okay. And again,

I just want to get a sense of
what these muscles are doing.

Yeah.

Okay, that's great.

And if you want to just come
and sit up at the side now.

Excellent. Okay.

Okay. So we've tested
your nervous system in

terms of whether it's
working as it should or not,

and everything's absolutely fine.

However, again, we know you've

got this sensation down
the back of your thigh

and sometimes that
can be related to

just some sensitivity
of the nerves.

Again, it doesn't mean anything's
wrong with them at all.

They just got highly
sensitive to some movement.

So we can easily check for that.

And all I need you to
do is lie on your back,

nice and comfortable with
you head on the pillow.

Okay. We'll take your
time. Same rules again.

If anything aggravates
your pain, let me know.

Yes. So we're going to do

this on your left leg,
first of all, okay?

And all I'm going to do, you're
going to keep your knee straight

and just lift your
leg off the bench.

And then I'm going to pull
your ankle a little bit, okay?

All you need to do is tell
me whether that affects

your back pain or your leg pain
on the right side or not, okay?

Okay, nice and flexible
on this side a bit of

tightness in your hamstrings
there that they all get okay.

And if I pull that down,

does that feel okay? Yes, fine.

Okay. And back.

I'm going to do the same
on this side. Oh, yeah.

Again, so can feel you're

reacting against that a
bit with your muscles

without letting me. Do
you feel about that?

I feel it, yeah. Okay.

Is that is that a tolerable amount

of pain or is it just
seven out of ten pain?

No, it's not that much.

Okay. And if I just bring Oh,

no. Getting worse now.

Okay. And if I push
that away, it's easy.

And if I bend your knee much
better. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

That's excellent. Thank
you Walid. Thank you.

Explain
